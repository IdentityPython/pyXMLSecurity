This is a python implementation of XML-Security - XML-DSIG only right now. There are no
dependencies except lxml and pyca/cryptography currently.

This code was inspired by https://github.com/andrewdyates/xmldsig (this implementation is
a refactor and extension of that implementation) and in former versions used to include a
pure-python RSA implementation https://github.com/andrewdyates/rsa_x509_pem by and with
permission from Andrew Yates. Cryptographic primitives are now provided by
pyca/cryptography (https://cryptography.io).

In order to sign with a PKCS#11-module you need to install pykcs11 (http://www.bit4id.org/pykcs11/)

This package is available under the NORDUnet BSD license (cf LICENSE.txt)

Limitations:

- only support for RSA-SHA1/256/512 signatures with PKCS1.5 padding
- no encryption support

Some of those limitations might be addressed. Patches and pull-requests are most welcome!
